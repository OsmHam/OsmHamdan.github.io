        <h3>Travel what it means to me</h3>
        <p>In today's digil age, social media might be an ideal tool for disabled travelers around the world to unveil the world's beauty, but travel is much more than getting that exquisite Instagram shot.</p>
        <br>
          <p>Travelling techees us about ourselves and each other(like family and friends), broadens our perspective on the world, and compels us to remain focused on what really matters, much like a reset button.
        Travel should have a purpose. It should enthrall and stimulate you, refresh, raise awarness and challange you, and most importantly, humble you.</p>
        <br>
      <p>In my opinion, Travelling is way of life. When I started being self aware as kid i really wanted to explore what secrets the world holds and meet new people. Which started of by travelling aroundby meeting people around country i lived and born in(Saudi Arabia).
      Getting to know different people from across the country and visting different cities. I habe come across many people that ihave inspired me. After traveling that country I discovered alot more  about it than ever before.</p>
      <h3>My thought process about travelling has changed now </h3>
      <p>It has been affected greatly when I was diagonesd with celiac disesase(gluten-allergy)in 2021. I need to make sure that the food is not cross contaminated with gluten (includes Wheat, Barley, Rye) which means gluten free food should not come in contact with food containing gluten even the utensils and surfaces that non-gluten food have been prepared or cooked with. As a Celiac Traveller I have to let go of the notion of needing to try the local cuisines. Since I have been diagonesed for like a year and I have never had  a noodles, pasta , pizza , or street food etc.. I have learn to eat simple foods when I’m traveeling about. Eat some fruit or nuts ,plain eggs for breakfast,grilled chicken for lunch. It’s difficult and exhausting, especially if you don’t know the language (which is why you should carry cards describing your dietary needs in the language of the countries you’ll be visiting. With limited english he assured me that this dessert was safe for gluten free. As I got to the bottom of the dessert, I realized that it sat on a base of  dish what seemed to be  bread. That evening, I spent the whole time at toilet with my hotel toilet.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>So I will share some of my travel experience before I was diagonsed with gluten allergy. The countries that I will share my thoughts about  turkey.</p>
