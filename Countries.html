    <h2>Hagia Sophia</h2>
  <p>Hagia Sophia is a holy place of worship for Muslims. The Hagia Sophia was a Byzantine engineering marvel of its time. It demonstrated the Byzantine Empire's splendour and grandeur. I went right after before the crowds showed. I strongly recommend  attempting that experience when my family could not sleep due to the time change, since it’s our first day in Turkey. But getting to explore the area at sunrise, when it's  was so peaceful and quiet, was one of my favourite memories of the entire trip.</p>

  <h2>Ortakoy</h2>

  <div class="column col11">
    <p>Ortaky is one of popular enterainment centers of Istanbul with it variety of great cafes, boutiues, shops, kumpir(sutffed baked patoto), and restuarents.
One of the best things to do in Ortakoy is to wander around the Ortakoy Square, watch the crowds, take a break, and hot bevearge at the various cafes and restaurants near the sea in the company of the Bosphorus. You can also take the boats from the Ortakoy coast, near the Ortakoy Mosque, on a Bosphorus cruise. From the Ortakoy coast, near the Ortakoy Mosque, individuals could also take the boats for a Bosphorus cruise.
Ortakoy's street markets are also extremely popular. Every weekend, they take place. Visitors can enjoy and purchase a wide range of handicrafts, souvenirs, used books, and other great items.

    <h2>ISTIKLAL STREET</h2>
    <div class="column col1">
    <p>Since the Ottoman Empire, Istiklal Street was once Istanbul's most popular and metropolitan district. As a result, there are many places that I have visited in Istiklal Street, such as historical passages, old restaurants like Hafiz Mustafa 1864 which he is  famous for his sweet, sugar and pastry, and colorful shops.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column col2">
        <p>this building where Cicek Pasaji stands was built in 1870 it is part of the  Istiklal street, there are ten different two passages - covered galleries with a through passage which are used for shops, cinemas, restaurants, confectionery, and other shopping and entertainment establishments. Historically, one of the passages adjacent to the fish market was known as "Flower passage." Now inside the cafe and various shops.</p>
      </div>
<div class="column col3">
  <p>Taksim Square is a large area that includes not only the plaza but also the roads leading to it, which are pedestrian only (no cars pass by) and contain all European branded shops, cafes, restaurants, and so on.
Because there is a Metro station nearby, getting there is simple. Shops are expensive by Istanbul standards because global brand prices are the same as in European countries, despite the fact that the cost of living in Istanbul is much lower. As a result, I would not recommend that you shop in this area.</p>

  <h2>Sultanahmet District</h2>
  <div class="column col11">
    Sultanahmet is a historic district of Istanbul.The square offers a good vantage point for many sites in Istanbul. Their you can see the Column of Contantine, the German Fountain, the Obelisk of Theodosius, and the Serpent Column. I was particularly impressed with the German Fountain, with its rich and vibrant colors in the dome, and the Serpent Column. From here, you can also photograph the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. If you get hungry, there are street vendors in the area.
